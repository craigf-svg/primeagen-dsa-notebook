# Algorithms in Python ðŸ““

This notebook follows [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/), with all algorithms and data structures implemented in Python!

## Why Iâ€™m Building This Notebook

Iâ€™m creating this notebook as a way of building a strong Python programming and algorithmic thinking base.

I also expect it will be a helpful guide for course takers who would prefer to learn these concepts in Python.

## ðŸ“š About

This notebook documents my progress on the course as I work my way through it, and for each section of the course I will be including:

- **Python implementations** of covered data structures and algorithms
- **Unit tests** written in pytest
- **Markdown notes** summarizing key concepts, ideas, and capturing memorable quotes from the course
- The occasional programming experiments (like my own 2D maze solver)
- Visualizations (including binary tree graphs in Mermaid and planned __ASCII among us art__)

## Getting Started

- Run `setup.bat` (Windows) or `setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) to quickly set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
- Or skip venv and install requirements manually: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run tests from the root directory with `pytest`
