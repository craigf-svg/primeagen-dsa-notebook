### üìÑ Why I‚Äôm Building This

As a helpful guide for course takers who would prefer to learn these concepts in Python. 

I‚Äôm also convinced that the best way to learn is to apply, and by writing these it helps me better understand the material.

### ‚Ñπ About

This notebook documents my progress on the course as I work my way through it, and for each section of the course I will be including:

- **Python implementations** of covered data structures and algorithms
- **Unit tests** written in pytest
- **Markdown notes** summarizing key concepts, ideas, and capturing memorable quotes from the course
- The occasional programming experiments (like my own 2D maze solver)
- Visualizations (including binary tree graphs in Mermaid and planned __ASCII among us art__)

### ‚≠ê Getting Started

- Run `setup.bat` (Windows) or `setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) to quickly set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
- Or skip venv and install requirements manually: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run tests from the root directory with `pytest`
