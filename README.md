# Algorithms in Python ðŸ““

My notebook following [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) - implemented in Python!

## Why Iâ€™m Building This Project

Iâ€™m creating this notebook to build a solid foundation in Python programming and algorithmic thinking.

I also hope it serves as a helpful resource for others following the course who prefer Python for learning these concepts.

## ðŸ“š About This Project

This project documents my ongoing journey through the course, for each section of the course I will be adding:

- **Python implementations** of covered data structures and algorithms
- **Unit tests** written in pytest
- **Markdown notes** summarizing key concepts, ideas, and capturing memorable quotes from the course
- Occasional code experiments (like my own 2D maze solver)
- Visualizations (including binary tree graphs in Mermaid and planned __ASCII among us art__)

## Getting Started

- Run `setup.bat` (Windows) or `setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) to quickly set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
- Or skip venv and install requirements manually: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run tests from the root directory with `pytest`
